						I have a BSc in Physical Science from the University of Guelph, an Advanced Diploma in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), and an MSc and PhD in Geography from the University of Victoria. I was a Lecturer in the School of Geography & Sustainable Development at the University of St Andrews, UK from 2013-2018. Starting January 2019, I became Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography, at Western University. I am interested broadly in GIScience, spact-time analysis, and the study of movement.
